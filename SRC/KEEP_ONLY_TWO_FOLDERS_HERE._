            If there was a fire in the building and you 
            could only take "LIB" or "NOT", you take "LIB"
            and you would not be at much of a loss.

    
    NOT:    Everything that is NOT "LIB"
            An "Other" folder if you will.


    I am conflicted between a "FLAT" file system that
    overwhelms the user when they see a ton of files in
    the repo, and a nested file structure that helps
    hone in on the important parts.

    Try to compromise somehow.... We need to make sure that
    someone who uses this library sees the most important
    things FIRST.
