
    V_1: My first attempt. I had refactored the code into
         A lot of different files. I find that hard to manage.
         Decided that only large chunks of functionality
         (think small programs) belong in their own files.

         Anything else is too granular.

         Exceptions for splitting library into
         [ DATA ] AND [ FUNC ] files, but don't get
         more coarse than that. Just makes things hard
         to navigate.
