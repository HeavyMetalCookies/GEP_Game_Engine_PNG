//:     Since we want things "C" like we need to think about
//:     how memory is managed. But not worry too much about
//:     how much memory is consumed. To get the actual data
//:     back we call "CopyInternalOutputBuffer".
//:     To keep the system running lean you call:
//:     "FreeInternalOutputBuffer()" to get rid of the
//:     memory malloced by the library when processing.

//:     TODO: GEP_FreeInternalOutputBuffer()
