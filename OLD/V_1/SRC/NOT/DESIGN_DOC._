
//:Coding standards:

//:1: Library prefix belongs in front of all functions
//:   and variables. This trumps any other prefix such
//:   as "VAL", "NEW", "MAC".
//:
//:   Reason:
//:     1: Requires only 1 "bit" of information to realize
//:        you are looking at "GEP" library code.
//:
//:     2: For old code that does NOT use "GEP_" prefix,
//:        modification does not wreck GREP searches.
//:
//:        VAL_tok_tok ---> GEP_VAL_tok_tok  (can still find)
//:        VAL_tok_tok ---> VAL_GEP_tok_tok  (harder to find)
